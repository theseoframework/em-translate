# Extension Manager translate
Here we maintain translation files for the [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/extension-manager/) plugin.

Select a branch to view the files. The latest POT file for the branch is included there, as well.

The files are manually synchronized to the update server (dl.theseoframework.com). 

## Open to PRs

Feel free to open a Pull Request with your latest translations, or send them to us [via our contact form](https://theseoframework.com/contact/)&mdash;tell us your GitHub account name to get props.

## Downloading

You can obtain the latest public versions via `https://dl.theseoframework.com/get/l10n/{branch}/{locale}/`.

Where `{branch}` is the version number, such as `2.4.0`, and `{locale}` is the locale, such as `es_ES`.

When [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/extension-manager/) is installed on your WordPress site, it'll use this endpoint.
